# Squadron Helper

This app was designed for the Google App Engine and its associated NoSQL database and is intended for use by an Air Force squadron in conjunction with the Squadron App to track users, aircraft, and users assigned to aircrafts. This is essentially an API and it  will accept GET, POST, UPDATE, and DELETE requests and the appropriate action will be carried out in the database.
