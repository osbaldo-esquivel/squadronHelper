# Squadron Helper

This app was designed for the Google App Engine and its associated NoSQL database. This app is intended for use by an Air Force squadron to track users, aircraft, and users assigned to aircrafts. The app will accept GET, POST, UPDATE, and DELETE requests and the appropriate action will be carried out in the database.
